    <p><b>Q: Why is it important to be mindful and active during the pandemic?</b></p>
    <p>A: With stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions, people can spend as much as 90% of their day sitting in front of a screen — 
      and Zoom fatigue is all too real. Many people find themselves stressed and exhausted, which impacts their mood,
      sleep habits, relationships with others, and other important parts of daily life. That's why it's important to unwind and 
      take some time off just for yourself, where you can focus on your physical and mental health.</p>

    <br>
    
    <p><b>Q: What kind of benefits can you get from working out?</b></p>
    <p>A:  Working out releases endorphins, which can counter
      stress and anxiety, and can even help you get a better night's sleep. Research has shown that those who exercise
      for just 30 minutes a day experienced reported being happier, feeling healthier, and having better self-image issues
      than their sedentary counterparts. Plus, doctors recommend having a regular exercise routine to improve cardiovascular
      health and prevent heart disease and strokes. It's easy to let yourself get exhausted after constantly moving from screen
      to screen. Regular exercise can help clear brain fog and assist you in focusing on what you need to get things done. </p>
